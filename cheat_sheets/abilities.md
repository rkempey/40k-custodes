</ul>

## DAUGHTERS OF THE ABYSS   

<ul>
    <li>This unit cannot be targeted or affected by psychic powers.</li>
    <li>Each time a Psychic test is taken for a unit, subtract 1 from the total for each unit with this ability within 18" of that unit (to a maximum of -3)</li>
    <li>Each time an attack made by a model in this unit targets an enemy PSYKER or DAEMON unit within 6" of it, add 1 to that attack's wound roll.</li>
</ul>

## FROM GOLDEN LIGHT

During deployment, if every model in this unit has this ability, then you can set up this unit in a teleportarium chamber instead of setting it up on the battlefield. If you do so, then in the Reinforcements step of one of your Movement phases you can set up this unit anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 9" away from any enemy models.
